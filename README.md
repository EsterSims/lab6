This project pulls information from a public API name Holiday API.
I was going to use node.js but it got a little complected 
I made it a simple one page site to demonstrate reading from a JSON file and the user can select the month to view.

It is for the year 2016 since accessing future dates require a paid account.

The Holiday API URL is : https://holidayapi.com/

Their GitHub for node.js is  https://github.com/joshtronic/node-holidayapi  

All you need to do is download the files and run the index.html page
